> # Reflection #
Reflection provides objects (of type Type) that encapsulate assemblies, modules and types. You can use reflection to `[1]`
  * dynamically create an instance of a type,
  * bind the type to an existing object,
  * or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.
  * If you are using attributes in your code, Reflection enables you to access them.
