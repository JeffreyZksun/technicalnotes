The goal of template is to support type-safe, efficient generic containers and generic algorithms. -- Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++.

Generic programming is a data structure-independent way of developing and delivering algorithms that need not be bound to a specific object. Templates are an ideal method to realize the generic programming dream.
