 = Garbage collection =
*Collection*
Garbage collection occurs when one of the following conditions is true: {{{[1]}}}

 * The system has low physical memory.
 * The memory that is used by allocated objects on the managed heap surpasses an acceptable threshold. 
 * GC.Collect is called.

*Generations*
The heap is organized into generations so it can handle long-lived and short-lived objects.

 * *Generation 0*. This is the youngest generation and contains short-lived objects. An example of a short-lived object is a temporary variable. Garbage collection occurs most frequently in this generation.
 * *Generation 1*. This generation contains short-lived objects and serves as a buffer between short-lived objects and long-lived objects.
 * *Generation 2*. This generation contains long-lived objects. An example of a long-lived object is an object in a server application that contains static data that is live for the duration of the process.

*GC process*
