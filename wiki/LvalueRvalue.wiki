 = lvalue & rvalue =
 * Lvalues are addressable. non-const lvalues are also assignbale.
 * Rvalue is neither addressable nor assignable.
 * Lvalues name objects that persist beyond a single expression. ++i is lvaue and i++ is rvalue.
 
 = lvaue reference & rvalue reference =
 * Lvalues strongly prefer binding to lvalue references. Rvalues strongly prefere binding to rvalue references.
 * Modifiable expression weakly prefer binding to modifiable references.
