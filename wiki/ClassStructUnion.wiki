 = Class, struct, union =
 There are three class-key, which are class, struct and union.
 
Members of a *class* are *private* by default, whereas members of a *struct* and *union* are *public* by default. (11/2 ISO/IEC 14882-2003)

Class declared by *class* class-key is *private* inherintance by default, and class declared by *struct* class-key is *public* by default.  (11.2/2 ISO/IEC 14882-2003) {*Note*: The default access specifier is only determined by the class-key used to declare the derived class, no matter which class key is used for the base class declaration.}


A union can have member functions (including constructors and destructors), but not virtual functions. A union shall not have base classes. A union shall not be used as a base class. (9.5/1 ISO/IEC 14882-2003)
